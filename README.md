# BIKES-SALES-ANALYSIS
This Tableau dashboard delivers a focused demographic view of bike sales, highlighting who buys bikes and under what conditions.
Project overview:
This project analyzes bike purchase behavior using a customer dataset containing fields such as gender, marital status, income, education level, occupation, home ownership, car ownership, and region.
The Tableau dashboard aggregates these attributes to reveal high‑value customer segments and factors that drive bike sales.
Dashboard features Stacked bars at the top compare bike purchase status across gender and marital status, quickly surfacing which demographic combinations show the highest conversion.
Distribution charts for home ownership, number of cars, occupation, and region provide a clear picture of lifestyle and location patterns among bike buyers versus non‑buyers.
An average income by occupation view quantifies purchasing power across roles, supporting precise targeting and positioning of bike products.

Key insights:
Bike purchases are concentrated in specific demographic bands where income, home ownership, and limited car ownership align, indicating segments with both ability and motivation to buy.
Certain occupations and regions consistently exhibit higher bike adoption, suggesting where marketing spend and inventory planning will generate the best returns.
Combining demographic filters in Tableau enables stakeholders to simulate scenarios, refine campaigns, and monitor how sales respond to targeted strategies over time.
